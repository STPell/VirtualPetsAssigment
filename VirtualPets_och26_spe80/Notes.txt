The Command line version has been included in case the GUI version fails for some reason.

The UML diagram has two blue boxes - these are to group together two groups of classes:
1. Every class that inherits from JPanel
2. Every class that has 0..* Observables and implements Observer
This was done because arrows going from all of these to Observable, Observer, and JPanel
would have severly cluttered the diagram, making it unreadable.
